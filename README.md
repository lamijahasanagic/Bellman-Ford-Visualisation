# Bellman-Ford-Visualization
The implementation and visualization of the Bellman-Ford algorithm.

## Description
The solution allows the user to enter the number of nodes that is desired. The branches are added subsequently between any two of the created nodes. Weighted graphs are supported as well, in which case the weight of each branch should be entered as well.
